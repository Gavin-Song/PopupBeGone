PopupBeGone is a chrome extension designed to automatically remove annoying popups, such as the ones that ask you to
register for a newsletter, disable your adblocker or download a free e-book.

You can also use the keyboard shortcut (Ctrl-Shift-X) to automatically kill the current modal on the screen.
There is also a whitelist so you can add sites you don't want to block popups on.
